   <p> "So, the plan?" Said Fundy
    "I don't know, I thought ypun had one." said Wilbur.
    "I wish we could have just a <b>free</b> country. ANyine can do anything." Said Toby.
    "OH! I have a plan!" Said Fundy <br>
"What?" Said Tommy <br>
"We create a new nation, like you said Toby. Where everyone's free" Said Wilbur. <br>
"That was my idea" Said Fundy. <br>
"No one cares" Tommy said </p>

<p>After that day, theybstarted to build their nation. Walls of obsidian to protect it from evil. 
    Clay, ruler of the Claylands, was <b>not</b> ok with this... so he decided to go. To. War.
