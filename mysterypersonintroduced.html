<h1>Who's this?</h1>
<p>"You're free" Said Sapnap, with an annoyed look on his face. "How? Why?" Wilbur asked himself. While Tommy on the other hand, he just was happy and went out immediatly after hearing the news. Wilbur stopped Tommy, grabbing his wrist, saying "Why?" with a dead serious look on his face. He thought it was a trap.</p>
<p>Sapnap told him "Friend of yours bailed you out."<br>
"Friend of ours?" Asked Wilbur  <br>
"I don't know, a guy named Fundy." Said Sapnap<br>
"Tommy, that a friend of yours?" <br>
"No, don't know anyone of that name" <br>
"Strange..." <br> 
"You guys wanna go or?" <br>
"Sure..." Wilbur Said.</p> 

<p>They got out seeing a person starring. <br>
    "Hey, I'm Fundy." The person starring said. <br>
    "You're the one who bailed us out?" Tommy Said <br>
    "Yes" He Said <br>
    "Why?" Said Wilbur <br>
    "'Cause I need a favour" He said. <br>
    "What kind?" Said Tommy <br>
    "I just wanna join your little buisness" He said, smirking. <br>
    "Ok. I can do that" Said Wilbur. <br>
    "WE can do that" Said Tommy.
