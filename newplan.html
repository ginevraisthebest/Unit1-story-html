    "Okay, so new plan, yoiu find a way to escape while I finish this banana" said Wilbur. 
    "Fine, whatever" Tommy said. He thought that maybe they could call a friend, but they wouldnt let prisoners call. So he thought he could bribe them, with the money they gained they could easily do that. Problme was, Sapnap was very devoted to Clay.
